GPS driver for Android Things
=================================

This driver supports GPS peripherals that generate NMEA location sentences over UART.

NOTE: these drivers are not production-ready. They are offered as sample
implementations of Android Things user space drivers for common peripherals
as part of the Developer Preview release. There is no guarantee
of correctness, completeness or robustness.

How to use the driver
---------------------

NOTE: on Raspberry Pi 3 you need to disable the serial debugging console using
the following [instructions][pi3-instructions] in order for the driver to be
able to access the UART port.

### Gradle dependency

To use the `gps` driver, simply add the line below to your project's `build.gradle`,
where `<version>` matches the last version of the driver available on [jcenter][jcenter].

```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.google.android.things.contrib:driver-gps:<version>'
}
```

### Sample usage

```java
import com.google.android.things.contrib.driver.gps.NmeaGpsModule;

// Access the GPS module:

NmeaGpsModule mGpsModule;

try {
    mGpsModule = new NmeaGpsModule(
            uartPortName,
            baudRate        // specified baud rate for your GPS peripheral
    );
    mGpsModule.setGpsAccuracy(accuracy); // specified accuracy for your GPS peripheral
    mGpsModule.setGpsModuleCallback(new GpsModuleCallback() {
        // overridden methods
    });
} catch (IOException e) {
    // couldn't configure the gps module...
}

// Close the GPS module when finished:

try {
    mGpsModule.close();
} catch (IOException e) {
    // error closing gps module
}
```

Instead of reading location directly, you can register the GPS module with the system and receive
location updates using the [Location APIs][location]:
```java
NmeaGpsDriver mGpsDriver;

try {
    mGpsDriver = new NmeaGpsDriver(
            this,           // context
            uartPortName,
            baudRate,       // specified baud rate for your GPS peripheral
            accuracy        // specified accuracy for your GPS peripheral
    );

    mGpsDriver.register();

    // At this point you can get the current location and request updates using the location APIs
    // provided by Google Play Services (or LocationManager if you don't have Play Services).
} catch (IOException e) {
    // couldn't configure the gps driver...
}

// Unregister and close the input driver when finished:

mGpsDriver.unregister();
try {
    mGpsDriver.close();
} catch (IOException e) {
    // error closing gps driver
}
```
