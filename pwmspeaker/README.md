PWM Speaker driver for Android Things
=====================================

This driver supports speaker and piezo buzzer peripherals using the PWM protocol.

NOTE: these drivers are not production-ready. They are offered as sample
implementations of Android Things user space drivers for common peripherals
as part of the Developer Preview release. There is no guarantee
of correctness, completeness or robustness.

How to use the driver
---------------------

### Gradle dependency

To use the `pwmspeaker` driver, simply add the line below to your project's `build.gradle`,
where `<version>` matches the last version of the driver available on [jcenter][jcenter].

```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.google.android.things.contrib:driver-pwmspeaker:<version>'
}
```

### Sample usage

```java
import com.google.android.things.contrib.driver.pwmspeaker.Speaker;

// Access the speaker:

Speaker mSpeaker;

try {
    mSpeaker = new Speaker(pwmPinName);
} catch (IOException e) {
    // couldn't configure the speaker...
}

// Make it play:

try {
    mSpeaker.play(440 /* tone */);
} catch (IOException e) {
    // error setting speaker
}

// Stop a currently playing tone:

try {
    mSpeaker.stop();
} catch (IOException e) {
    // error stopping speaker
}

// Close the speaker when finished:

try {
    mSpeaker.close();
} catch (IOException e) {
    // error closing speaker
}
```
