Sense Hat driver for Android Things
=====================================

This driver provides easy access to the peripherals available on the Raspberry Pi [Sense Hat][product]:
- 8x8 LED matrix
- TODO: 5 buttons joystick
- TODO: Sensors


NOTE: these drivers are not production-ready. They are offered as sample
implementations of Android Things user space drivers for common peripherals
as part of the Developer Preview release. There is no guarantee
of correctness, completeness or robustness.

How to use the driver
---------------------

### Gradle dependency

To use the `sensehat` driver, simply add the line below to your project's `build.gradle`,
where `<version>` matches the last version of the driver available on [jcenter][jcenter].

```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.google.android.things.contrib:driver-sensehat:<version>'
}
```

### Sample usage

```
// import the SenseHat driver
import com.google.android.things.contrib.driver.sensehat.SenseHat;
```
```
// Color the LED matrix.
LedMatrix display = SenseHat.openDisplay();
display.draw(Color.MAGENTA);
```
```
//  Display a drawable on the LED matrix.
display.draw(context.getDrawable(android.R.drawable.ic_dialog_alert));
```
```
// Display a gradient on the LED matrix.
Bitmap bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(SenseHat.DISPLAY_WIDTH, SenseHat.DISPLAY_HEIGHT, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);
Canvas canvas = new Canvas(bitmap);
Paint paint = new Paint();
paint.setShader(new RadialGradient(4, 4, 4, Color.RED, Color.BLUE, Shader.TileMode.CLAMP));
canvas.drawRect(0, 0, canvas.getWidth(), canvas.getHeight(), paint);
display.draw(bitmap);
```
```
// Close the display when done.
display.close();
```
